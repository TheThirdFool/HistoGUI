HistoGUI

HistoGUI is a very low overhead plotter that interfaces with X11 to plot data.

HistoGUI is written entirely in C++ and can be included in any C++ analysis scripts for all your plotting needs.

To use consult the example script.

At the moment, it doesnt love negative numbers. This is a result of being used to display spectra etc.
