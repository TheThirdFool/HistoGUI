HistoGUI

HistoGUI is a very low overhead plotter that interfaces with X11 to plot data.

HistoGUI is written entirely in C++ and can be included in any C++ analysis scripts for all your plotting needs.

To use consult the example script.

Note that you can draw on it with the "middle mouse click".

Rebinding keys has to be done manually now in the code. I will fix this when I have time.
