HistoGUI

HistoGUI is a very low overhead plotter that interfaces with X11 to plot data.

HistoGUI is written entirely in C++ and can be included in any C++ analysis scripts for all your plotting needs.

To use consult the example script.

Note that you can draw on the plot with the "right mouse click". This can be cleared with the "middle mouse button".
